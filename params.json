This is a non-commercial project \r\nand anyone can add his contribution. JLayer is licensed under LGPL (see LICENSE.txt).\r\n\r\n\r\nFAQ : \r\n---\r\n\r\n- How to install JLayer ?\r\n  Before running JLayer you must set PATH and CLASSPATH for JAVA\r\n  and you must add jl1.0.1.jar to the CLASSPATH.\r\n\r\n- Do I need JMF to run JLayer player ?\r\n  No, JMF is not required. You just need a JVM JavaSound 1.0 compliant.\r\n  (i.e. JVM1.3 or higher).\r\n\r\n- How to run the MP3TOWAV converter ?\r\n  java javazoom.jl.converter.jlc -v -p output.wav yourfile.mp3\r\n  (Note : MP3TOWAV converter should work under jdk1.1.x or higher)\r\n\r\n- How to run the simple MP3 player ?\r\n  java javazoom.jl.player.jlp localfile.mp3\r\n   or\r\n  java javazoom.jl.player.jlp -url http://www.aserver.com/remotefile.mp3\r\n  Note : MP3 simple player only works under JVM that supports JavaSound 1.0 (i.e JDK1.3.x+)\r\n\r\n- How to run the advanced (threaded) MP3 player ?\r\n  java javazoom.jl.player.advanced.jlap localfile.mp3\r\n\r\n- Does simple MP3 player support streaming ?\r\n  Yes, use the following command to play music from stream :\r\n  java javazoom.jl.player.jlp -url http://www.shoutcastserver.com:8000\r\n  (If JLayer returns without playing SHOUTcast stream then it might mean \r\n   that the server expect a winamp like \"User-Agent\" in HTTP request).\r\n\r\n- Does JLayer support MPEG 2.5 ?\r\n  Yes, it works fine for all files generated with LAME.\r\n\r\n- Does JLayer support VBR ?\r\n  Yes, It supports VBRI and XING VBR header too. \r\n\r\n- How to get ID3v1 or ID3v2 tags from JLayer API ?\r\n  The API provides a getRawID3v2() method to get an InputStream on ID3v2 frames.\r\n\r\n- How to skip frames to have a seek feature ?\r\n  See javazoom.jl.player.advanced.jlap source to learn how to skip frames.\r\n\r\n- How much memory/CPU JLayer needs to run ?\r\n  Here are our benchmark notes :\r\n    - Heap use range : 1380KB to 1900KB - 370 classes loaded. \r\n    - Footprint : ~8MB under WinNT4/Win2K + J2SE 1.3 (Hotspot).\r\n                  ~10MB under WinNT4/Win2K + J2SE 1.4.1 (Hotspot).\r\n    - CPU usage : ~12% under PIII 800Mhz/WinNT4+J2SE 1.3 (Hotspot).\r\n                  ~8% under PIII 1Ghz/Win2K+J2SE 1.3.1 (Hotspot).\r\n                  ~12% under PIII 1Ghz/Win2K+J2SE 1.4.1 (Hotspot).\r\n                  ~1% under PIII 1Ghz/Win2K+J2SE 1.5.0 (Hotspot).\r\n\r\n- How to contact JLayer developers ?\r\n  Try to post a thread on Java&MP3 online forums at :\r\n  http://www.javazoom.net/index.shtml\r\n  You can also contact us at jlayer@javazoom.net for contributions.\r\n \r\n\r\nKNOWN PROBLEMS :\r\n--------------\r\n99% of MP3 plays well with JLayer but some (1%) return an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException \r\nwhile playing. It might come from invalid audio frames. \r\nWorkaround : Just try/catch ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in your code to skip non-detected invalid frames.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
